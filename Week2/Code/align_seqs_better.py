##### 1 doesnt work but is what I would like to do 

#print(Doc)
#r=[]
##list(r)
#  ## why won't tiis work? prob set operations??
# for n in Dictionary:
#       if Doc[n]!= Doc[n-1]:
 #          r.append(Doc[n])
####2 runs but only gets one value
#Dict=max(Dictionary, key=Dictionary.get)
#print(Dict)
#Out={}
#for d in Dict:
#    Out.append(Dictionary[d])
#for d in Dictionary:
#    if d is Dict:
#        Out[d]=Dictionary[d]
#print(Out)
#only gets one!!

######quite stuck.
